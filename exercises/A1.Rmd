Exercise A1 -- Categorical Data Analysis
========================================

**Question 1 **

Open ExerciseA1\_Data. What percent of respondents said they were "Very
Happy"? What about "Not too happy"? "Pretty happy"? Use a graph to
display the variable.

**Question 2**

Do women appear to be more or less happy than men? Would you say this
apparent relationship is statistically significant?

**Question 3**

Create a scatter plot of respondent's education vs. their spouses'
education. Does this relationship appear to be linear? Add a linear
regression line to the plot. Inspect the correlation between the
respondent's education and their spouses' education. Is this correlation
positive or negative? Is it statistically significant.

Exercise A1 Solution
====================

**Question 1 **

Open Exercise12\_Data. What percent of respondents said they were "Very
Happy"? What about "Not too happy"? "Pretty happy"? Use a graph to
display the variable.

**Solution: **

-   We have one categorical variable that we would like to
    investigate...check the all on one page handout!

-   "Analyze" "Descriptive Statistics" "Frequencies"

**Question 2**

Do women appear to be more or less happy than men? Would you say this
apparent relationship is statistically significant?

**Solution: **

-   We are going to compare two categorical variables. From out handout,
    we will use Pearson Chi-Square crosstabs to do this!

-   Enter the following information

    -   Rows: sex

    -   Columns: happy

![](./media/image49.png){width="4.628517060367454in"

-   Select the Statistics button

    -   Check the box for Chi-Square

    -   Select Continue

-   Select the Cells button

    -   Check the box for Row under Percentages (leave the rest as
        default)

    -   Check the box for Adjusted Standardized Residuals under
        Residuals (leave the rest as default)

-   Select the box for Display Clustered Bar Charts

-   Select Ok

-   The Pearson Chi-Square statistic indicates that the differences
    between men and women are statistically significant
    (pvalue/asymptotic significance\<.05).

-   The residuals, clustered bar chart, and row percentages can tell us
    where these differences arise

    -   An adjusted standardized residual (absolute value) greater than
        two shows us where the differences between groups occur. Here,
        we see that "not too happy" for males and females has a residual
        greater than 2.

    -   The row proportions indicate that there is a higher proportion
        of females that responded "not too happy" when compared to
        males.

    -   The clustered bar chart also shows that there are greater
        numbers of women that indicate that they are "not too happy".

**Question 3**

Create a scatter plot of respondent's education vs. their spouses'
education. Does this relationship appear to be linear? Add a linear
regression line to the plot. Inspect the correlation between the
respondent's education and their spouses' education. Is this correlation
positive or negative? Is it statistically significant.
