Exercise 8 Solutions
====================

Open Exercise8\_Data.sav

**Part 1**: Investigate the variable attributes. Determine which
variables are categorical variables (nominal and ordinal), and which
variables are continuous (scale).

Solution:

Open the dataset (Exercise8\_Data)

Select the "Variable View" tab

Investigate the labels and measure of each variable

Obtain the appropriate descriptive statistics for each variable in the
dataset. Remember, continuous variables should be investigated with
5-point summary descriptives and categorical variables should be
investigated with frequency tables.

Solution:

Descriptives:

-   Select Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Descriptives

<!-- -->

-   Select the following variables: sibs, childs, age, educ, paeduc,
    maeduc, speduc, prestg80

-   Select "OK"

-   Notice there are only 519 respondents that have valid data points
    for all of the continuous variables.

-   Investigate the output

**Part 3**: Assess the distribution of the Occupational Prestige Score
("prestg80") with both a histogram (normal curve displayed) and a Q-Q
plot. Is the assumption that the population of Occupational Prestige
Scores is normally distributed reasonable?

Solution:

-   Histogram in Legacy Dialogs

-   Select Graphs - Legacy Dialogs - Histogram

-   Variable: prestg80

-   Check box to display normal curve

-   Select OK

-   Investigate the output

-   Look to see how well the plotted points follow the solid diagonal
    line

-   It is particularly important to pay attention to the "tails", or the
    left most and right most points to see if they follow the line

    sex

-   Select Data - Split File

-   Select "Compare Groups"

-   Select the variable sex for "Groups Based on:"

-   Select "OK"
