# Execise Solutions

## Exercise 1

In order to analyze data properly in SPSS, we need to follow the
guidelines set out above. Open Exercise1\_Data and see what guidelines
we have ignored.

height="3.2511712598425198in"}

Solution:

Too much information is contained in one variable
(CTSSurgTypeCatCodeDesc, LOS, SURGLOS, DCDate, etc.)

Errors can easily be found by sorting (errors in Year, AGE)

The same content is entered in differently for a single variable (SEX,
HTN, SMOKING)

Anything else?

## Exercise 2 

Open Exercise2\_Data (an Excel file). Modify this Excel file such that
it can be imported into SPSS properly. Save the file and close it. Open
the file in SPSS (import it). Export this file back into Excel, but only
save the following variables: id, salary, minority.

![](./media/spss-exer-image2.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.440387139107612in"}

Solution:

-   Delete the first three rows of data (remove heading)

-   Remove rows 23 and 24 (contains summary information)

-   Remove the formatting (fill color)

-   Save the file as Exercise2\_Data\_Ready

-   Close Exercise2\_Data\_Ready

![](./media/spss-exer-image3.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.440387139107612in"}

-   Open SPSS

-   Select File - Open - Data

-   Under "Files of Type" select either "All Files" or "Excel" to view
    Exercise2\_Data\_Ready, select the file, then select "Open"

-   A window appears

-   Check the box so the variable names will be imported

-   Select the sheet of the Excel file that you would like to be read
    in, then select "Ok"

-   The Excel data should now open in the Data Editor

## Exercise 3

Open Exercise3\_Data and go to Variable View. Practice defining the
correct attributes to each variable by following the code book.

![](./media/spss-exer-image8.png){width="6.0625in"
height="3.320896762904637in"}

Solution:

-   In Variable View, the first four columns do not need to be modified

-   To modify the variable label, click in the cell that you wish to
    edit and start tying in the label

-   To modify the value labels, click the cell that you wish to edit and
    then select the box with three small dots. The following window will
    appear:

![](./media/spss-exer-image9.png){width="4.854166666666667in"
height="3.125in"}

-   Ender the value and label, then select "Add". Once all possible
    value labels are added, select "OK"

-   When value labels (or other attributes such as label or missing)
    repeat for a variable, you can copy and paste the attribute values.
    Right click on the cell you want to copy, select copy. Then right
    click on the cell that you would like to paste in, and select paste.

![](./media/spss-exer-image10.png){width="6.5in"

    missing values

-   Use the drop down menu for "Measure" to specify the correct
    measurement type

-   Save this file as Exercise3\_Data\_Cleaned
