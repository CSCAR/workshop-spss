**The Data (Refer to Final Project Folder)**

The cars data sets contain data on specifications of 406 vehicles from
1970 to 1982. Among the variables in the data set are information on
fuel consumption (mpg), horsepower, weight, acceleration, origin
(Europe, Japan, U.S.), and number of cylinders.

The data set contains categorical variables (such as origin), numerical
discrete variables (such as number of cylinders), and continuous
variables (such as weight, and acceleration).

**Getting Started**

1)  Investigate cars\_wave1.xls and cars\_wave2.xls and prepare the data
    for SPSS

2)  Open SPSS and import cars\_wave1.xls and cars\_wave2.xls from
    Microsoft Excel.

3)  Merge cars\_wave1 and cars\_wave2 (add cases).

4)  Save this new SPSS file!

5)  Using the codebook below, define the proper attributes in Variable
    View

height="2.295138888888889in"}

**Working with Variables**

1)  Recode Origin such that 1=Domestic, 0=Foreign. Remember to recode
    into a different variable. Give this new variable the proper
    attributes in variable view.

2)  Convert Miles Per Gallon (MPG) to Liters Per 100 Kilometers

    a.  Use the Compute function

    b.  The formula to use: LP100K=(100\*3.785)/(1.609\*MPG)

3)  Export this SPSS data set to Microsoft Excel (it's always good to
    have a back up!). Export all of the variables.

**One Variable Procedures**

1)  Get descriptive statistics for all scale variables in the data set.

2)  Get frequency tables for all categorical variables (ordinal or
    nominal) in the data set.

3)  Create a histogram of Horsepower.

4)  Create a histogram of Weight.

5)  Create a QQ Plot for Weight (Analyze Descriptive Statistics QQ Plot
    Select Weight, leave others as default settings OK)

6)  Create a bar chart for Origin.

7)  Organize the output by Year (Analyzing groups of cases separately,
    compare groups). Before proceeding, select only cases with Year not
    = 0.

    a.  Investigate Horesepower (descriptive statistics)

    b.  Investigate Weight (descriptive statistics)

    c.  What do you see?

    d.  Remember to turn the Split File command off before proceeding!

**Relationship Between Continuous Y (Horsepower) and Continuous X
(Weight)**

1)  Create a Scatter Plot with Horsepower as the Y variable and Weight
    as the X variable.

    a.  Add a Linear fit line.

    b.  What is the relationship between Horsepower and Weight as shown
        in this graph?

2)  Calculate the Pearson and Spearman Correlation coefficients for the
    relationship between Horsepower and Vehicle Weight.

    c.  What is the p-value for the Pearson correlation?

    d.  What is the actual p-value, as opposed to the p-value that is
        displayed? To display the actual p-value for the Pearson
        correlation, double-click on the Pearson correlation output
        table and double-click on the p-value. (Remember, p-values
        cannot actually be equal to zero. The p-value you will see
        displayed, after double-clicking, will be in scientific
        notation.)

**Relationship Between Continuous Y and Numerical Discrete/Ordinal X**

1)  Before doing any analyses, select only cases with Year not = 0.

2)  Create a side-by-side boxplot of MPG vs. Year. Choose MPG as the
    "variable" and Year as the "category axis".

3)  What is the general trend of MPG across years?

**Relationship Between Continuous Y and Nominal X**

1)  Create a side-by-side boxplot of Miles per gallon vs Country of
    Origin (ORIGIN). (Note: even though Origin is numeric in the data
    set, its values are **nominal**: American, European, Japanese).

2)  What is the general relationship between MPG and the Origin of the
    car?

3)  Create a side-by-side Boxplot of Miles per gallon vs. the recoded
    Country of Origin (1=Domestic, 0=Foreign).

Final Steps

1)  Export the SPSS output into Microsoft Excel

2)  Select a few tables and/or charts that you would like to present and
    paste them into Microsoft Word
